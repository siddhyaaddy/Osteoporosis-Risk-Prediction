# Osteoporosis-Risk-Prediction


The purpose of this study is to use medical history analysis to assist patients in determining their risk of
osteoporosis. Bones gradually deteriorate due to osteoporosis, which is frequently ignored until a fracture
happens. Bone health is improved by early identification, which enables prompt care, particularly in older
persons.
